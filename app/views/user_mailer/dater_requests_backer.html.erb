    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <h3>
      <%= @requestor.f_name.capitalize%> would like you to be their "FRamily Member" on PYTDating.com.</h3>

      <p>PYT Dating (Petition Your Tribe Dating) is an online dating service with twist!  Instead of browsing through potential matches on your own, your Tribe fills out information about you and suggests matches for you to check out.</p>

      <p>Do you really want <%= @requestor.f_name.capitalize%> to be alone forever? We didn't think so.</p>
        <h3>Follow this link to sign up or connect:
        <%= link_to 'Accept Invitation!', @url, class:'primary-btn btn-sm', id:'accept-invitation-button'%>.
      </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Happy Meddling!</p>
